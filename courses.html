                GIS/MEA582: Geospatial Analysis and Modeling</a>
        </h4>
        <p>
            The course explains digital representation and analysis of
            geospatial phenomena and provides foundations in methods and algorithms
            used in GIS analysis. Special focus is on terrain modeling, geomorphometry,
            watershed analysis and introductory GIS-based modeling of
            landscape processes (water, sediment).
            The course includes analysis from lidar data, coastal change assessment and 3D visualization.
            All assignments are done in two software packages &ndash; GRASS GIS and ArcGIS &ndash;
            to untangle general geospatial analytical concepts from software specifics.
            The <a href="http://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/geospatial-modeling-course/grass">GRASS GIS part</a>
            is very popular even outside NCSU.

        </h4>
        <p>
            The course covers emerging field of open science and
            deals with reproducibility and replicability challenges
            of computational research. The students gain a
            hands-on experience with tools used by scientists to create
            geospatial research which can be validated by the wider
            geospatial community. Several geospatial open source tools
            are discussed in connection with general-purpose and
            text authoring tools such as next generation interactive
            documents and revision control tools. Although the focus of
            the course is open science, many of the tools used in the
            course are used in the industry. The course covers how
            open source communities and software development process
            work and how to apply this for research in a lab group.

            The course covers monitoring, analysis, and modeling of 3D
            landscape change using Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and lidar data.
            The principles of UAS data collection, processing of 3D point clouds
            and the resulting terrain models are explained followed by hands-on
            experience with multitemporal data collected by
            the NCSU NextGen Air Transportation (NGAT) program.
            The course also covers techniques for analysis and visualization
            of lidar data time series and outputs of dynamic simulations,
            including immersive visualization at the Hunt library facilities.
            The students will have the opportunity to work with the Tangible Landscape system
            to explore impact of 3D terrain change on landscape parameters and processes.

            This course focuses on theoretical concepts and computational methods
            that describe, represent and simulate the functioning of real-world
            processes. We define the general properties of geospatial computation
            and explain the role of simulations in analysis and understanding of
            observed phenomena, testing of hypotheses and theories, and prediction
            of spatio-temporal systems behavior. We discuss the current methods
            and techniques for simulations using deterministic, stochastic and
            rule-based models as well as agent-based simulation of complex systems.
            Hands-on component of the course will cover implementation of simulations
            in GIS and advanced applications driven by the student’s research.
            Open science tools will be used for assignments. Prior programming
            experience is expected.
